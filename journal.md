I just enrolled in the class. I had to miss the first lecture because I enrolled after the first lecture took place.

I personally hate resistors, so I used an internal pull up resistor to avoid using phyiscal ones. I didn't run into many issues but one that stood out was potnetiometer giving weird and inconsistent values making the servo go crazy. I experimented with another servo and another potentiometer and even different wirings, but the problem was i had the grn and 5v wires inverted apparently. I also utilized the serial monitor to basically verify and debug all my inputs and outputs. It helped with reading inputs from the button, reading inputs from the potentiometer, and seeing how the potentiometer values are mapped to the servo values.

## Homework 3

Here's my moodboard

my idea for the project here is to have mobs like creepers and zombies wandering around. they could be hung with strings and a dc or stepper motor on top that moves them around. we can also add a villager behind the zombie to make it look like th villager is chasing the zombie. I also can attacha  pickacke to a servo motor. the pickaxe can be 3d printed and assembeled. it acn be attached to the servo from the middle to make it rotate. One of the machines from the last project has something similar on top with mtoors and metal bars connecting the motors to make things move around. my biggest worry hoenstly is fabrication because i am not very good at fabrication. but the good thing about choosnig minecraft is that everything is blocky so 3d desgining and printing the objects shouldnt be as hard and shouldnt require a lot of percision since everything is mostly blocks. even circles are made out of tiny blocks. The thing i can't think of though is music, like we can have minecraft music but it doesn't stand out. I want something that reaaaally stands out.

## feedback on last class project

For the first project from the left, it was the sea and pirate ship project. I don't like that there are two buttons and I personally would have liked to see consistency accross the project such that all of them have one button, this one kind of ruined that flow.

The screw that holds the ship to the giant servo that moves it came off, and the ship stopped rotating because of that. To avoid this issue, i suggesting in class that the screws should have split washers on both sides to make sure they stay in place better. What i love about this project is the clever way it moves the waves. each wave is connected to a servo with chains on one end and a spring on the other end to create an effect that simulates waves going back and fourth, this was really really clever and I love it. I wish the project had more going on though, like it was a little bit underwhelming. But I liked the mechanism that uses strings to open and close shells, I took a note of that and I want to implement somehting similar in my project. Overall, I want to learn how to move things with servos and strings because that seems like such a good skill to have, to I will definitely start learning that.

for the second project, the one with the horses, a lot of things were broken. Their only thing to show was the horses and the rotating base, and the base was not rotating so that's half of the project not working. The horses were working though, they were going up and down and honestly I really like how most of the wiring and all the motors are hidden on the top. I like when wiring is hidden. But as we can see that's a nightmare to debug if sealed, so points taken off for that, but still rewarded for hiding things haha.



The third project, the candy shop, I love the music. I would really like to know why one of the bunnies broke but I don't think it was a design issue. overall this project has the best fabrication, its really eye catching and really really well put together. One thing I like is their clever use of neopixels and using their sign as a diffuuser because neopixel lght can be very very very bright. I also like how they used the same wired for the first and the second sign, in contrast to the next project that we will cover in a bit

For the fourth project, the gluinng was bad in my opinion, a lot of things were unglued. But i really love the clouds, my biggest issue about this project is using a blllion wires for the neopixels, and the wires are all out and as a multimedia designer this really maeks me uncomfortable. each cloud had its own pin and its own 5 volts and ground wires, i really spend 2 days trying to figure out why that was needed and I still cant find the answer. I unfortuntely dont have a picture for the wires but u can zoom in on the picture and see.


For the last project, MISSED OPPORTUNITY. they really could have made their neopixels in the fireworks flash, but they stay as a constant color.also the ferris where doesn't rotate anymore but I love the project honestly. I saw in one of the ferris wheel cabins a couple kissing and thats a cute detail to add. overall I like this project but they also had really bad gluing.
