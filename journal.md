I just enrolled in the class. I had to miss the first lecture because I enrolled after the first lecture took place.

I personally hate resistors, so I used an internal pull up resistor to avoid using phyiscal ones. I didn't run into many issues but one that stood out was potnetiometer giving weird and inconsistent values making the servo go crazy. I experimented with another servo and another potentiometer and even different wirings, but the problem was i had the grn and 5v wires inverted apparently. I also utilized the serial monitor to basically verify and debug all my inputs and outputs. It helped with reading inputs from the button, reading inputs from the potentiometer, and seeing how the potentiometer values are mapped to the servo values.
