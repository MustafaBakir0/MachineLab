I just enrolled in the class. I had to miss the first lecture because I enrolled after the first lecture took place.

I personally hate resistors, so I used an internal pull up resistor to avoid using phyiscal ones. I didn't run into many issues but one that stood out was potnetiometer giving weird and inconsistent values making the servo go crazy. I experimented with another servo and another potentiometer and even different wirings, but the problem was i had the grn and 5v wires inverted apparently. I also utilized the serial monitor to basically verify and debug all my inputs and outputs. It helped with reading inputs from the button, reading inputs from the potentiometer, and seeing how the potentiometer values are mapped to the servo values.

## Homework 3

Here's my moodboard

my idea for the project here is to have mobs like creepers and zombies wandering around. they could be hung with strings and a dc or stepper motor on top that moves them around. we can also add a villager behind the zombie to make it look like th villager is chasing the zombie. I also can attacha  pickacke to a servo motor. the pickaxe can be 3d printed and assembeled. it acn be attached to the servo from the middle to make it rotate. One of the machines from the last project has something similar on top with mtoors and metal bars connecting the motors to make things move around. my biggest worry hoenstly is fabrication because i am not very good at fabrication. but the good thing about choosnig minecraft is that everything is blocky so 3d desgining and printing the objects shouldnt be as hard and shouldnt require a lot of percision since everything is mostly blocks. even circles are made out of tiny blocks. The thing i can't think of though is music, like we can have minecraft music but it doesn't stand out. I want something that reaaaally stands out.
